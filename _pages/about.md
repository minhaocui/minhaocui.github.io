I am a reserach assistant professor at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr), [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I received PhD degree from Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Xiong](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~jxiong/).

My research vision is to **explore pervasive existing signals to broaden and enhance the perceptual capabilities of both humans and computers**. 

My research interests lie in **mobile computing**, **wireless sensing**, **wireless communication**, **cyber-physical systems**, and **HCI**.
